# SVG to Vector Drawable Converter
Convert SVG images to Android VectorDrawable XML resource files [online](https://svg2vector.com).

Put the output XML files into the ‘res/drawable’ directory of your app and reference to them in XML / Java code as to ordinary drawables.

_This repo serves as our primary way of keeping [track of bugs](https://github.com/logicfactory/svg2vector/issues)._
